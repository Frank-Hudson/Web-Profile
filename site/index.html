                <p>
                    I'm Frank Hudson, and this is my second profile website (you
                    can find my first
                    <a href="https://frank-hudson.github.io/old-portfolio-website/"
                        >here</a
                    >).
                </p>

                <p>
                    I was born on <span class="italic" id="birthday"></span>,
                    making me <span class="italic" id="age"></span> years old.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I am a web and general software developer with a passion for
                    creating beautiful and functional websites.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Here, you can find information about me, my abilities, and
                    my achievements.

                <h3>Ambitions</h3>

                <p>
                    My specific primary ambition is to create at least one
                    popular game by the end of my time on this Earth. One
                    enjoyed my the masses, played casually on weekends, or
                    competitively throughout the week.
                </p>

                <p>
                    But as a matter of fact, I do not mind if what I create is
                    not a video game, I only wish to inspire people to follow
                    their hearts and dreams, to create many more wonderful
                    things, long after I am dead and gone! I just want to leave
                    a mark on this world, great enough to be mentioned somewhere
                    by someone in some written work.
                </p>

                <h3>Opinion Time!</h3>

                <p>
                    Though I am not vicarious, about my passions, my beliefs,
                    and my values, I do fervently believe in many as firmly as
                    the redwood, and as fiercely as the tiger. A small list of
                    some of those I am most passionate about, and willing to
                    share, resides below. Take a gander and meander through
                    them, if you wish, but if you do not agree with some of
                    these statements of opinion, then I do not agree with you. I
                    will still respect you, should you treat people with the
                    same diginity and respect, but I do not have to like you.
                </p>

                        No matter how bad the situation, violence will never be
                        the right solution; there will always be a peaceful
                        solution

                        Equality is always good. If it compromises or hurts one
                        group or individual in favour of another or others, it
                        is not equality

                    For more than 500 years now, I have roamed the wilds of this
                    desolate rock, staying in your mud-huts and stone cubes, and
                    I have come to a conclusion.
                </p>

                <p>
                    That conclusion is: Your world is full of plotholes. You
                    need better writers.

                    If I had a nickel for every time I died and came back, I'd
                    have no nickels, which isn't a lot, but it's normal that it
                    didn't happen.
