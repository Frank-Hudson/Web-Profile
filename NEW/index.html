                    <p>
                        I'm Frank Hudson, and this is my second profile website (you
                        can find my first

                        >).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I was born on <span class="italic" id="birthday"></span>,
                        making me <span class="italic" id="age"></span> years old.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I am a web and general software developer with a passion for
                        creating beautiful and functional websites.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Here, you can find information about me, my abilities, and
                        my achievements.

                    <h3>Ambitions</h3>

                    <p>
                        My specific primary ambition is to create at least one
                        popular game by the end of my time on this Earth. One
                        enjoyed my the masses, played casually on weekends, or
                        competitively throughout the week.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        But as a matter of fact, I do not mind if what I create is
                        not a video game, I only wish to inspire people to follow
                        their hearts and dreams, to create many more wonderful
                        things, long after I am dead and gone! I just want to leave
                        a mark on this world, great enough to be mentioned somewhere
                        by someone in some written work.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Opinion Time!</h3>

                    <p>
                        Though I am not vicarious, about my passions, my beliefs,
                        and my values, I do fervently believe in many as firmly as
                        the redwood, and as fiercely as the tiger. A small list of
                        some of those I am most passionate about, and willing to
                        share, resides below. Take a gander and meander through
                        them, if you wish, but if you do not agree with some of
                        these statements of opinion, then I do not agree with you. I
                        will still respect you, should you treat people with the
                        same diginity and respect, but I do not have to like you.
                    </p>

                            No matter how bad the situation, violence will never be
                            the right solution; there will always be a peaceful
                            solution

                            Equality is always good. If it compromises or hurts one
                            group or individual in favour of another or others, it
                            is not equality
                        </li>

                            For more than 500 years now, I have roamed the wilds of
                            this desolate rock, staying in your mud-huts and stone
                            cubes, and I have come to a conclusion.

                            That conclusion is: Your world is full of plotholes. You
                            need better writers.

                            If I had a nickel for every time I died and came back,
                            I'd have no nickels, which isn't a lot, but it's normal
                            that it didn't happen.
